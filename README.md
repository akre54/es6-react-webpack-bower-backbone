React, Backbone, Webpack and ES6 walk into a bar....
===========================================================

A sample project setup using React.js, Backbone.js, Webpack, Gulp,
ECMAScript6 modules, based on an example by @caseywebdev.

It should hopefully give an example of how to fit all these technologies
together.
